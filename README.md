## Grey Hack 
A personal collection of scripts, tools, macros, and programs I've developed for the hacking simulation game **[Grey Hack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/)**.

This repository contains my **in-development work**, **production-ready tools**, and a curated set of tools from other developers for learning and inspiration.
